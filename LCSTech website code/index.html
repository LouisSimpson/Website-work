		<h1>The low budget, scavenged, frankenstein "gaming" PC build!</h1>	
	<h3>24th of June 2016</h3>
	<p class="centretext">
		<b>When we are younger many of us dream of owning the latest in technology such as gaming consoles and the next "in thing" just to be told we couldnt have it. Our parents would give us excuses like,
		you dont need that, or the most common one thats far too expensive! which now i am older and appreciate the value of money a little more i fully agree with them, but when you are a 14 year old
		who doesnt understand money all that well, being told no seems like the worst thing ever!
		<br/><br/>
		This is where the frankenstein build comes in.
		<br/><br/>
		My passion for PC gaming all began when i visited a friends house, his dad had this gaming PC which back then was the bee's knees! it had the latest graphics card in there and the latest cpu and 
		everything. i thought it was the most amazing thing, which back then the technology probably was to the right person (me). The pc was in my friends office so we were only alllowed on it at certain
		times of the day which were mostly at night but we made the most of the time we had. we would stay up all night playing crisis 2 and call of duty 4 (still the best call of duty) eating pot noodled
		and doritos and mtn dew of course. after the weekend of PC gaming i had just done i was hooked .... and so the frankenstein PC build was born...
		<br/><br/>
		I went home and spoke to my uncle who i knew had previous experience with PC building and started to plan building my own PC. After what seemed like months of serching through websites and looking
		at pages after pages of brand new hardware, i quickly came to realise that buying brand new hardware at my age with no job just wasnt an option so i turned to the second hand market. I messaged
		family members asking if they had any old computers that they no longer needed with my fingers crossed that i could get enough compatible parts to build something, anything! to feed my need to get
		back onto a PC and start gaming again.Finaly after weeks i managed to get 4 systems from various people all with various parts and this is when the "son of frankenstein" was born!
		<br/><br/>
		I removed all the sticks of ram and all the cpus from the systems and started my research, i looked at which processor out of the ones i had was the fastest and which had the most cores etc then
		found a motherboard that it would fit in and then put as much compatible ram i could get my hands on in there and fired the baby up! obviosuly i installed the psu and other parts as well but you get
		what i mean. It worked! some how, i dont know how, the very first pc that i had built booted up first time into the bios! was this some sort of wizadry?! I then got my hands on a copy of windows xp,
		i know not the best decision but come on i was a rookie! installed it and there it was my very first "gaming" pc.
		<br/><br/>
		Shorlty after getting it to boot for the first time and getting over the fact that something I had built which to some and probably still me at the time seemed like a near impossibility worked, i 
		came to a stand still ... i realised i had no games to install onto it! what a disaster! so onto the internet i went and i ordered my very first pc game ...Fallout 3. i waited 2 days for it to arrive 
		and i think i installed that game faster than anything i have ever installed in my life! it was done, the game was installed it was ready to fire it up and play! finally after weeks of waiting and 
		building i had my own gaming pc! only to be greated to what only can be described as the worst frame rate issue i have ever whitnessed... obviously this was my first PC build so i didnt know what was
		missing or why would it be doing this so i phoned a friend, apparently a gpu is pretty important in a gaming pc (i know right what a idiot) Of course again i had no ides what was good what was bad, 
		so i ordered a nvidia gt 610, yes a gt not a gtx. i had high hopes for this card because as far as i was concerned it would be amazing and would play the games i wanted to play so i put it into my pc 
		and fired Fallout 3 back up ... it worked! the frame rate issue was no more! The computer ran smoothly after this and i continued to install games onto it and play games into the early hours of many 
		many days. This was the beginning of not only my PC gaming passions but my passions for building custom pc's. I then grew up a few years and got my self a job and this is when the real machine was 
		built.
		<br/><br/>
		I will try and get together a list of parts for the "son of frankenstein" build but some of the hardware is very old so i will try my best :p
